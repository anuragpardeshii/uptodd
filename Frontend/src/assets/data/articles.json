                    "Babies have a natural urge to suck onto things. This urge usually decreases after the age of 6 months. But many babies continue to suck their thumbs to soothe themselves and engage in thumb sucking. It can become a habit in babies and young children who use it to comfort themselves when they feel hungry, afraid, restless, quiet, sleepy, or bored. So let us see what our development Expert Dr Clara Guru has to comment on it.",

But any thumb sucking behvaiour post that age can cause significant developmental issues that are not just limited to physical or oral aspect but can extend to their cognitive growth too. If your baby is indulged in the thumb sucking behaviour after 2-4 years of age it is always best to identify triggers and help them correct the wrong behaviour patterns developed in form of thumb sucking.",
